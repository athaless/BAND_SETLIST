# BAND_SETLIST
Keeps the "repertoire" of songs and can generate "setlists" by time and quantity for band rehearsals and gigs


# LABIRINT

It's an algorithm for a 3D Labirint (simulated) that I invented when I was a kid in 1988. It's just a technic that I created at that time to play and have fun learning MSX Basic and starting C programming at those time.
